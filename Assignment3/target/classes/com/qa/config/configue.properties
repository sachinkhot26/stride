keywordIdentifierText = The Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast Woodlands: The Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole. The nations rapidly assimilated white culture, raised stock, operated large farms, traded extensively with whites, adopted Christianity, owned Black slaves, and were educated at mission schools. It was the "mixed-bloods" who readily adapted to white civilization; the "traditionalists" did not. The Indian Removal Act of 1830, and the Treaty of New Echota, 1835, led to the Trail of Tears.
sentimentAnalyzerText =  His performance was okay, but compared to others really good.
summaryText = I could visit this place four times and give it four different reviews. Today there was a long wait at the cutting table, which was (at first) staffed by three different people. The little number-giving-out machine was empty, so we all just stood in an orderly line. One of the women at the cutting table left right after I got there (there were five of us in line then) saying that she was already late for her break. I didn't like to see her go, but I understood about the break thing (sometimes you *really* need your break, and sometimes your manager *really* wants you to take your break at the scheduled time).   It took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric. If I was that customer I'd have been thrilled at that level of service.   So I finally got my stuff cut. The woman cutting it was very efficient (but I think a little rattled from being so busy) and admired my choice of fabric (hey, I love to be validated).   I went up front and stood in line some more. There were, unusually, three different people working the registers. The woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric (I'm starting to think it's not my great taste but some new policy).   So not a great visit but not the worst, either.
